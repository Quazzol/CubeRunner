# CubeRunner
CubeRunnerDemo

Sample project using outsource assets and Unity version 2020.3.24f1.

Levels can be totally or partially random generated depending on a state set by GameManager property.

All prefabs loaded from "Resources" folder, thus integrating new prefabs with correclty set interfaces
is enough to be used in game.
